In this post, I'll (try to...) show you what happens in Linux when you press `<Ctrl-C>` in an interactive `bash` shell.

## Customizing your `^C`

...but why not have some fun first? Ever wondered where does that `^C` string come from? Tired of it? Apply this to your `bash`:

```diff
diff --git a/lib/readline/signals.c b/lib/readline/signals.c
index f9174ab8a014..93b4b637122a 100644
--- a/lib/readline/signals.c
+++ b/lib/readline/signals.c
@@ -765,7 +765,7 @@ rl_echo_signal_char (int sig)

   if (CTRL_CHAR (c) || c == RUBOUT)
     {
-      cstr[0] = '^';
+      cstr[0] = '%';
       cstr[1] = CTRL_CHAR (c) ? UNCTRL (c) : '?';
       cstr[cslen = 2] = '\0';
     }
```

```console
ypl@home:~/bash$ ^C
ypl@home:~/bash$ ./bash
ypl@home:~/bash$ %C
ypl@home:~/bash$
```

Yay! You just customized your `^C` (a.k.a. "special control characters").

## WIP

Tired, more stuff coming soon...
